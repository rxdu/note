## Concepts

The [launch](https://github.com/ros2/launch) and [launch_ros](https://github.com/ros2/launch_ros) packages provide a set of API to model the configuration and starting of ROS2 nodes. The "launch" package provides the base classes and the "launch_ros" package provides ROS2 specific extensions.

* **launch.LaunchDescription**: this is the main class used to describe the launch configuration. It is a list of "actions" that are executed sequentially. The launch configuration is executed by the launch service.
